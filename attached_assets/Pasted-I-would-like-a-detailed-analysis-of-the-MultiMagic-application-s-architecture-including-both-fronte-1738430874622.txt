I would like a detailed analysis of the MultiMagic application's architecture, including both frontend and backend components. Put the final analysis into a file.

Please provide the following details:

1. Overall Architecture
Identify the structure of the application (e.g., monolithic, microservices, client-server).
Explain how the frontend and backend communicate (e.g., REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets).
Identify key dependencies and frameworks used in both frontend and backend.
2. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Describe the main structure of the frontend (e.g., component hierarchy, routing, state management).
Identify key UI components and their roles.
Explain how state management is handled (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Context API).
Identify how API calls are made (e.g., Axios, Fetch API, GraphQL client).
Look for reusable UI components and design patterns used.
Identify any styling solutions used (e.g., CSS modules, Tailwind, Styled Components).
3. Backend
Identify the backend framework used (e.g., Express, NestJS, Koa).
Explain the API structure (e.g., RESTful endpoints, GraphQL resolvers).
Describe how authentication and authorization are handled (e.g., JWT, OAuth, session-based).
Identify database interactions (e.g., ORM used like Prisma, TypeORM, Knex).
Explain how business logic is structured (e.g., services, controllers, middlewares).
Identify background jobs or scheduled tasks (if any).
4. Database (PostgreSQL)
Describe the database schema and key tables.
Identify relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
Check for database migrations and seed data (e.g., using Knex, Prisma, TypeORM migrations).
Look for indexing strategies and performance optimizations.
5. DevOps & Build Process
Identify the build process and package management (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Parcel).
Check for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins).
Identify any Docker or containerization setup.
Look for environment configuration (e.g., .env files, secrets management).
6. Additional Considerations
Identify any unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.
Look for logging and monitoring solutions.
Identify error handling mechanisms in both frontend and backend.
Highlight any notable security considerations.
7. Summary & Recommendations
Provide a high-level summary of the application's architecture.
Suggest potential improvements or areas of optimization.
Highlight any best practices that are followed well.
